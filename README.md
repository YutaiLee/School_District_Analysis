# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the project
### Purpose
The purpose of our analysis is to find out the overall pass rate of students and see if there is any correlation with each studentâ€™s budget. We discovered that some of Thomas High School's 9th grade test scores were missing. Therefore, we use the "NaN" value to replace the math and reading scores of the ninth grade students to adjust the previous analysis and rerun the results.
### Result
The result after replacing the math and reading scores of all ninth grade students with "NaN" (as shown below):
